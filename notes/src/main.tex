\chapter{Introduction}

\chapter{Electricity's Fundamentals}

Electricity is, in simple terms, (...)

Positive charges and negative charges are, per charge:

\begin{gather}
    Positive: \ 1.6x10^{-19}C \\
    Negative: \ 6.24x10^{18}e
\end{gather}

They're both in the measuring unit of the other.

\section{Coulomb's Law:}

We mathematically define Coulomb's Law as:

\begin{gather}
    F = K \cdot (\frac{Q\cdot q}{r^2})
\end{gather}

a few important constants come from:

\begin{gather}
    K = \frac{1}{4\pi\cdot \epsilon}\\
\end{gather}

\section{Current}

When we have a group of charging moving at the same time, we can measure it in amperes, the specific 
measure can be explained mathematically as:

\begin{gather}
    [I] = A = \frac{1C}{1S}
\end{gather}

This is a measure of unit that has a direction, and is inherently vectorial.
It is also the main way we'll measure electricity in this course

\section{Resistivity}

It is possible to control Current through resistant materials that can stop partially the flow of electrons. 
This comes in a sense, as a consequence of Ohm's Law. 

We can calculate resistivity as:

\begin{gather}
    R = \rho(T^o) x (\frac{L}{A})
\end{gather}

This 'R' we have in the previous formula is actually an Ohm, and can also be written as $\Omega$.

\subsection{Ohm's Law}

We can use Ohm's Law to describe the way that resistivity can be interpolated from.

We can define it through the following formulas:
\begin{gather}
    I_R = \frac{V_R}{R}\\
    R = \frac{V_R}{I_R}
\end{gather}

\subsection{Effects driven by temperature}

Temperature can make it so there are more or fewer free electrons. The higher the temperature, the more free electrons;
In a sense this happens because heat physically is a measure of how much (...). The fact there are little to no electrons helps 
the current technology on superconductivity.   

\subsection{Aislants}

An Aislant is meant to make resistivity as large as possible, and even though perfect aislants are, in practice, impossible to achieve,
it makes the flow of electrons negligible. 

\section{Conductivity}

The opposite of Resistivity is conductivity. This is measured in Siemens, and can be expressed as:

\begin{gather}
    [G] = S = \frac{1}{\Omega}
\end{gather}

\section{Closed and Open Circuits}

We can think on circuits being broadly classified in two: An open circuit, which implies (...), or a closed circuit, which
implies (...).
\section{Potential on a Circuit}


We can describe the 

\chapter{Kirchoff's Laws}

\section{Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)}

We can use the laws established by Kirchhoff to describe the behavior of current. 
and/or voltage. At it's most basic, we can describe Kirchhoff's laws, or KCL, as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $$\sum_{node} i_{enter} = 0$$
    \item $$\sum_{node} i_{out} = 0$$
    \item $$ \sum_{node} i_{enter} = \sum_{node} i_{out} $$
\end{itemize}

This means that to describe a current we'll 
have to assume the current output and the current input of
electrical signals will have a zero sum and that they will be equal to
each other. Either of these definitions will be interchangeably useable. 

For defining a circuit, we should do this for every node in a circuit so we can
define a linear equation model. But we probably wouldn't want to define a whole circuit only 
through KCL, because even though computationally it can technically be done, if we were to calculate
the values of an entire circuit through Kirchhoff alone, it would generally give us 
linear equation systems that are fairly big and tedious, and can become a differential equation systems
in certain scenarios, adding even more complexity. We can see this because when
defining currents and voltages, the eventual complexity of the system can be defined as:

\begin{gather}
    I_r * V_r = n\\
    KCL = [n x n]
\end{gather}

\subsection{Gaussian Curves}

When we define a Gaussian curve, we can use KCL's laws on them as if every curve acted
as a node; Besides this, we can define closed circuits as specific gaussian curves, and 
to a certain extent, make inputs and outputs dependant on this. This can simplify a circuit 
system drastically.

\section{Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)}

There is the possibility to use a version of the previous law where
we don't measure Current, but voltage, this works through the following formula:
$$\sum_{c.c}V_{i} = 0$$

\section{Examples}

\paragraph{3,1}

Given two specific nodes, we'll have two serial resistances with . 

If we apply Kirchhoff's Voltage and Current law, then:
\begin{gather}
    V_{xy} = V_{xc} + V_{cy} <KVL> \\
    x \to I_X = I_{R1} ; c \to I_{R1} = I_{R2} ; y \to I_{R2} = I_x <KCL>
\end{gather}

And then, if we use Kirchhoff's Current Law:
