## Notes

As part of this project of mine, i'm providing a PDF with notes and the LaTeX template used to make it. You can find them inside of the `notes` folder of this repo. 

The template that was used in this project was produced using the Legrand Orange Book template, available [here](http://www.latextemplates.com/template/the-legrand-orange-book).
Original author of the Legrand Orange Book template: Mathias Legrand (legrand.mathias@gmail.com) with modifications by: Vel (vel@latextemplates.com). Give them some love!
